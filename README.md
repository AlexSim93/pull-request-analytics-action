## Motivation

**pull-request-analytics-action** addresses several key challenges:

1. **Identifying Bottlenecks in Code Review Processes**: Easily generate summaries showing where delays occur in the review stages.
2. **Tracking Trends in Code Review Processes**: Analyze how review dynamics change over time to identify positive or negative trends.
3. **Detecting Significant Deviations**: Identify metrics that vary significantly among teams and developers, revealing potential areas of concern.
4. **Simplifying Analysis of Notable PRs**: Provides a list of standout pull requests, helping you focus on the most critical cases.

Overall, this action enables faster and more accurate assessments, leading to better decision-making.

## Metrics

All metrics are presented in the form of tables, charts, and lists ([Report example](https://github.com/AlexSim93/pull-request-analytics-action/issues/16)). Below, you can see an example of such data.

### Lead Time

Displays the time from PR creation to each displayed status. Helps identify bottlenecks in the code review process. Use the `timeline` value in the `SHOW_STATS_TYPES` parameter.

### List of Notable PRs

Identifies standout pull requests, helping quickly locate the most pending PRs at various stages, the largest and the most commented ones. This facilitates analysis by focusing on the most significant cases. Here is an example of the most commented PRs.

1. [Feature: PR Title 1(example)(31)(Author: AlexSim93)](https://github.com/AlexSim93/pull-request-analytics-action/pull/15)
2. [Feature: PR Title 2(example)(27)(Author: AlexSim93)](https://github.com/AlexSim93/pull-request-analytics-action/pull/15)
3. [Feature: PR Title 3(example)(25)(Author: AlexSim93)](https://github.com/AlexSim93/pull-request-analytics-action/pull/15)

## Getting started

To integrate **pull-request-analytics-action** into your GitHub repository, use the following steps. The provided code is a template and can be adjusted to fit your specific requirements:

1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2. Create a YAML file, for example, `pull-request-analytics.yml`.
3. Open your new YAML file and paste the following example workflow. This is a starting template and you can modify it as needed:

   ```yaml
   name: "PR Analytics"
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
       inputs:
         report_date_start:
           description: "Report date start(d/MM/yyyy)"
         report_date_end:
           description: "Report date end(d/MM/yyyy)"
   jobs:
     create-report:
       name: "Create report"
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: "Run script for analytics"
           uses: AlexSim93/pull-request-analytics-action@v4
           with:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # In the case of a personal access token, it needs to be added to the repository's secrets and used in this field.
             GITHUB_REPO_FOR_ISSUE: # Make sure to specify the name of the repository where the issue will be created
             GITHUB_OWNER_FOR_ISSUE: # Make sure to specify the owner of the repository where the issue will be created
             GITHUB_OWNERS_REPOS: # Be sure to list the owner and repository name in the format owner/repo
             CORE_HOURS_START: "9:00"
             CORE_HOURS_END: "19:00"
             TIMEZONE: "Europe/Berlin"
             REPORT_DATE_START: ${{ inputs.report_date_start }}
             REPORT_DATE_END: ${{ inputs.report_date_end }}
   ```

4. Check your repository settings if you want to publish reports in issues. Go to the repository's **Settings**, and under the **Features** section, make sure the **Issues** checkbox is selected. Additionally, if you are collecting statistics for an organization's repository using a **personal access token**, ensure that the token has the necessary permissions. To do this, go to the organization's **Settings** and navigate to the **Personal access token** tab. Verify that the tokens (classic) have permission to access the repository.
5. Decide on which GitHub event you want to trigger the report generation. You can refer to the [GitHub Events Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) for a detailed understanding of different events. In this example, the `workflow_dispatch` event is selected to allow the action to be manually triggered multiple times with different parameters. `report_date_start` and `report_date_end` can be set before running the action without modifying the code.
6. Depending on your needs, you can use either the `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a generated **Personal Access Token (classic)**. In this example, we are using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, but keep in mind that it won't allow you to collect data from multiple repositories or organizations, nor will it provide data segmented by GitHub teams. If these features are critical for you, create a token with the **repo** and **read:org** scopes selected on [tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You can read more about tokens in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28).
7. Configure the parameters to suit your needs according to the [Parameters Overview section](#configuration-parameters-overview).
8. Merge the code into the main branch of the repository.
9. Open the **Actions** tab and select the created action from the left sidebar. In our case, it's `PR Analytics`.
10. In your repository, go to the **Actions** tab. Select **PR analytics** and start it via "Run workflow". Fill in any necessary parameters and execute the action. Depending on the number of PRs, it may take from 1 to several minutes to complete.
11. Open the **Issues** tab, where you'll find the generated report.

## Using GitHub Enterprise Server

**pull-request-analytics-action** supports integration with GitHub Enterprise Server. To use this feature, you need to set the `GITHUB_API_URL` environment variable:

1. In your workflow file, define the `GITHUB_API_URL` under the `env` key.
2. Set the value to your GitHub Enterprise Server API endpoint.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  GITHUB_API_URL: http(s)://HOSTNAME/api/v3
```

This configuration allows **pull-request-analytics-action** to interface with your GitHub Enterprise instance, enabling you to leverage the full capabilities of the action within your enterprise environment.

## Outputs

Below is a table describing the possible outputs of **pull-request-analytics-action**:

| Output Option     | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JSON_COLLECTION` | A string output containing a JSON object with all the data collected by the action. To receive this output, add `collection` to `EXECUTION_OUTCOME`. |
| `MARKDOWN`        | An output containing the report as a markdown string. To receive this output, add `markdown` to `EXECUTION_OUTCOME`.                                 |

## Recommendations and Tips

- Use a **Personal Access Token (classic)** to generate reports for multiple repositories or to support teams.
- Avoid running multiple actions simultaneously that use the same token. This will help prevent hitting secondary rate limits.
- Utilize the `schedule` event for optimal report updates. You can refresh the report every few hours or days to avoid exceeding rate limits and to keep the report up to date. You can find an example configuration [here](https://github.com/AlexSim93/pull-request-analytics-action/blob/master/configs/yearReportWithoutDevelopers.yml).
- To hide individual metrics, specify users in the `HIDE_USERS` parameter or leave `total` and GitHub team names in the `SHOW_USERS` parameter.
- To avoid a long list of title changes when updating an existing issue, it is recommended to set the title yourself using the `ISSUE_TITLE` parameter.
- You can filter pull requests using labels with the `EXCLUDE_LABELS` and `INCLUDE_LABELS` parameters.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a `Not Found` error:

- Check the scopes of your **personal access token** if you're using one.
- Verify that you have correctly specified the owner and repository.
- Ensure that you have access to the specified repository.
- If you're using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, remember that it only provides access to the repository where the action is running.

You can read more about this in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/troubleshooting-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#404-not-found-for-an-existing-resource).

## Privacy and Data Handling

**pull-request-analytics-action** is stateless; it does not send or store any of the collected data. However, to better understand user needs, fix bugs, and efficiently develop the project, some non-sensitive input parameters are sent to Mixpanel. These data are anonymous and do not provide any information that could identify the project or its data. If you wish to disable parameter data transmission, set `ALLOW_ANALYTICS` to `false`.

## Usage Limitations

**pull-request-analytics-action** operates within GitHub's API rate limits and message size constraints, which are generally sufficient for detailed, long-term reporting. However, in rare cases of extremely large datasets, some adjustments might be necessary. For more information, refer to GitHub's documentation on [rate limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api). The length of the report generated by **pull-request-analytics-action** is limited to 65,536 characters due to GitHub Issue size constraints.
